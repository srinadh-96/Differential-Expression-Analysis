# Differential-Expression-Analysis

## General Info
DESeq2, edgeR and NOISeq are three tools used for differential expression analysis. The DESeq2, edgeR and NOISeq folders contains R scripts to perform DE analyses with the specific tools.

## Note for DESeq2:
When running the R script, create three folders in the data directory, called "pvalue5", "pvalue10", "pvalue20" for different p-values. 

## Dataset 
The Data folder contains nine different count matrices, consisting of read counts for two different conditions(up and down).
the file name is structured in such a way that it represents "samples per condition_first_condition samples_second_condition_samples",
it also contains meta files corrresponding to each data file which is a groundtruth file, used to compare the predicted differentially expressed gense with the ground truth.

## Python script 
The Python script is used to calculate the accuracy of the identified differentially expressed genes. For the input, the Python script requires the output generated by the R script.

## Technologies
RStudio is used to run all the R scripts, and Jupyter Notebook to run python scripts and plot the graphs

## Setup
To run the R-scripts install the following packages:
- RStudio(4.1.1)
- NOIseq-2.36.0
- edgeR_3.34.1
- DESeq2-1.32
- Jupyterlab
